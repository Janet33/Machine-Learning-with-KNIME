# Machine-Learning-with-KNIME
This is an assignment based on Machine Learning with KNIME
# Purpose of the project
This project uses the MNIST dataset and seeks to train a model to predict 1 digit - for example the number 5. This “5-detector” is an example of a binary classifier, capable of distinguishing between two classes, 5 and not-5. In the second part, we will explore multiclass classifiers that predicts all classes.
# Questions 
- Binary Classifier
  - 1. Train a Decision Tree model and evaluate with Cross-Validation (use 5 folds) 
  - 2. Create a classifier with 90% recall 
  - 3. What does it mean to have a high recall and low precision? 

- Multiclass Classifier
  - 4. Train a Decision Tree model 
  - 5. Compute the macro and micro F1 scores
